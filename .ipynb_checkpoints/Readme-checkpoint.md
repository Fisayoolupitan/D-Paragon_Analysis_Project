### Conclusion, Recommendation and Future work

The Objective of this analysis is to give insights and possible solutions that would help understand areas where the company can improve and gain high customer retention.

`Improve Customer Retention`
- High Exit Rates in France and Spain (84% & 83%) indicate a serious retention issue.

Action: Conduct exit surveys to identify dissatisfaction drivers.
 Follow-up: Implement loyalty programs or personalized customer outreach to reduce churn.

 `Targeted Campaigns by Geography`
- Since France holds ~50% of the customer base, marketing efforts here will have the greatest impact.

 Action: Design localized campaigns focusing on the needs of French customers.
Spain: Since 50% of high-balance customers are from Spain, consider premium or wealth management services targeted at this segment.

`Engagement Based on Tenure`
- Segmenting by short-, medium-, and long-term tenure can guide lifecycle marketing.

Action:
 Short-term customers may need onboarding support.
 Medium-term may benefit from upselling or cross-selling.
 Long-term may be at risk of churn â€” consider loyalty perks.

`Focus on Inactive Members`
- Around 48.5% of customers are inactive.

Action: Launch reactivation campaigns (e.g., special offers, check-ins).
        Personalize outreach based on prior behavior or account activity.
